# REACT-BASIC

##  ReactDOM Basics with JSX and Babel

## Introduction

1. ## seize the day   

In this assignment, I have explored the basics of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The assignment focuses on creating UI elements using React and ReactDOM, and comparing these techniques with traditional JavaScript DOM manipulation methods.

2. ## JSX and Dynamic Rending in React 

This project is a part of an assignment focusing on JSX and Babel within React. The assignment involves creating a paragraph element using JSX at varying levels of complexity.

3. ## React Fragments and Event Handlings

This assignment is designed to demonstrate understanding of React Fragments, JSX syntax, classNames in React, and event handling and . The task involves creating a simple React component that displays text and includes a button that triggers an alert when clicked.

## *Assignment Details

## 1. Seize The Day

## Setup
1. Use the provided boilerplate HTML code with React and ReactDOM libraries included.
2. Use any text editor or IDE for editing HTML and JavaScript files.
3. Open your HTML file in a web browser to see the results.

## Tasks

1. Create a React Element: Use React.createElement to create a paragraph (<p>) element with the text "Seize the day".
2. Render with ReactDOM: Use ReactDOM.render to mount the created React element into the <div id="root"></div> container in your HTML document.

## Reflection

Consider the differences between manipulating the DOM using traditional JavaScript and React's approach. Reflect on the benefits of React's declarative UI elements over direct DOM manipulation.

## Resources

1. `React Documentation`
2. `ReactDOM Documentation`

## 2. JSX and Dynamic Rending in React 

## Setup

1. Clone or download the provided boilerplate HTML file.
2. Ensure you have internet connectivity to load React and Babel libraries via CDN.
3. Open the HTML file in a browser to see the rendered React component.

## Problem Statement

* React Fragment Wrapper
Wrap the JSX code in a React Fragment (<React.Fragment> or <>...</>).
* Paragraph Element
Include a paragraph (<p>) element with the text “React is a JavaScript library”.
* Div Element with Class "main"
Create a div element with the class name "main".
This div should contain:
    1. A paragraph element with the text “Click the below button to alert 'Hello'”.
    2. A button element with the text “Alert Hello”.

## Button Functionality

Clicking the button should trigger an alert with the message “Hello”.

## Additional Challenges (Optional)

Apply inline styles to the div element to enhance its appearance.

## 3. React Fragments and Event Handlings

## Project Structure

1. index.html: The main HTML file that includes the React, ReactDOM, and Babel scripts. This file also contains the script where JSX elements are created and rendered.
2. README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and its contents.
 
## Levels of Complexity

* Simple JSX Element
Objective: Create a paragraph element using JSX to display the text "Seize the day".
* Dynamic Content in JSX
Objective: Enhance the paragraph element to include dynamic content.
* Conditional Rendering in JSX
Objective: Implement conditional rendering within the JSX element.

## Usage

To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The JSX code will be compiled by Babel and rendered in the browser.
